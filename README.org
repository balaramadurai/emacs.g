* Spacemacs-Lite

This config is for people who are either:
1. Starting out with emacs
2. Or tried out Spacemacs and were overwhelmed by the list of customization possible.

Here is my .emacs.d config. I've learnt from the internet, I thought I should return the favour :)

* Quick Start

You'll need emacs before we start off with this - http://wikemacs.org/index.php/Installing_Emacs

Once you have installed Emacs, you can start with this. Copy the following commands line by line and press ENTER

#+begin_example
 # if you have a pre-existing config, also backup your .emacs from your home directory
mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.bak  
git clone  --recurse-submodules http://github.com/balaramadurai/.emacs.d
# Launch emacs and enjoy!
#+end_example

* Motivation
I started using Spacemacs and I fell in love with the ease of use and the thought that has gone in to developing every brick of the emacs customization. But, somehow, there were some keybindings that I wanted it my way and it was increasingly getting difficult to have it my way. Creating a layer and maintaining it also seemed to be an uphill task. Although, I did manage it at the end. Somehow, I needed something that was, let's say, light. At around the same time, I came across this talk by Suyash Bire, who talked about a Spacemacs-Lite. This concept appealed to me and I copied most of the code that I wanted from watching him. Eventually (in about a week's time), he did share his settings on github. 

That inspired me to do 2 things - 
1. Share my config so that someone else like me might benefit, and
2. To have my config under a VC rather than Dropbox it. 

That was my motivation, the list of whom I was inspired by are given below - [[*Inspiration][Inspiration]] .

* Get Started
** Step 0: Install Emacs
http://wikemacs.org/index.php/Installing_Emacs
** Step 1: Git clone or download the config
One way to use this config.org to make it your own is:
#+begin_example
 # if you have a pre-existing config, also backup your .emacs from your home directory
mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.bak  
git clone --recurse-submodules http://github.com/balaramadurai/.emacs.d
#+end_example

** Step 2: Configure your spacemacs.secret.org
Use the template provided =spacemacs.secret.org.template=
#+begin_example
mv spacemacs.secret.org.template spacemacs.secret.org
#+end_example

** Step 3: Launch Emacs 

Your emacs will open up in default =poet-theme=. You can customize this using =SPC t t=

** Step 4: Customize the packages
How to add a new package to your config:

Type the words =<muse= and =TAB=
#+begin_example
<muse <TAB>
#+end_example

You'll get this
#+BEGIN_SRC org :exports src
,#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
(use-package 
:ensure t
; :diminish
; :general
; :config
)
,#+end_src
#+END_SRC
Type the name of the emacs package from http://melpa.org or use =SPC p l= for listing packages.

Go to the last parenthesis and type =C-x C-e= and the package will be installed for you. 

** Step 5: Delete packages
If you want to remove a package, delete the package with its emacs-lisp code block in this file and also =SPC p d=.

By defining shortcut keys/keybindings for each package, you can make sure that when you decide to uninstall a package, the shortcut keys also go away

** Step 6: Check the list of shortcuts/keybindings (Spacemacs Mnemonics)
To make shortcut keys, use the =:general= and type in =(spacemacs-leader-key <shortcut key in quotes> '<macro>'=.

I have evil (Vim emulation) enabled by default, hence I'd strongly recommend learning practicing "evil-mode" using =evil-tutor= using (=SPC h T=)

** Shortcuts

The long list of shortcut keys are given below, as defined my this config file:
All these work in all evil modes *except* =insert=
